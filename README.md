# 🛒 Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data using various regression algorithms. The aim is to assist businesses in forecasting future sales and optimizing inventory and marketing strategies.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `sales-prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder containing datasets (e.g., advertising.csv).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 📊 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Model evaluation with metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² Score.
- Sales prediction on new/unseen data.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction.git
   cd sales-prediction
````

2. **Install required libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sales-prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run all cells to see the analysis and results.**

## 📈 Model Performance (Example)

| Model             | MAE   | RMSE  | R² Score |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| Linear Regression | 234.5 | 301.2 | 0.82     |
| Random Forest     | 187.4 | 240.1 | 0.91     |

> *Note: Actual performance may vary depending on dataset and parameters.*

## 📦 Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Incorporate time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
* Deployment as a web app (Streamlit/Flask)
